[`argcompile`][PyPI] is a Python package made to improve native [`argparse`][1] command-line parsing library by include some design classes that allows defining post-processing of supplied arguments. Check [package description](DESCRIPTION.md#argcompile) for more information and [examples](DESCRIPTION.md#Example).


## Getting started
Make sure you have at least [Python 3.6 installed][2]:
```
$ python3 --version
python 3.6.0
```

Since, from this version, [pip][3] already comes together with Python, you'll be able to download package [latest release][PyPI] available in PyPI:
```
pip3 install argcompile
```

## Acknowledgements

This tool was developed after reach an [`argparse` limitation][4] that is actually an old-dated [reported issue][5] and has already a huge refactor [solution proposed][6] in which `argcompile` was based on.

@hpaulj's proposal modifies the standard library making it more flexible to be extended, considering several usage situations and code improvements. `argcompile` otherwise implements a flavor of this mechanisms without much concern and with a simpler and limited approach.
